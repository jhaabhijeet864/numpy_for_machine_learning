## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into **phases** to reflect the progression of your learning journey:

### Phase 1: NumPy Basics and Fundamentals

- **Topics Covered:**
  - Creating arrays from lists
  - Difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays
  - Creating arrays from scratch (`zeros`, `ones`, `full`, `random`, `arange`)
  - Understanding vectors, matrices, and tensors
  - Array properties (`shape`, `ndim`, `size`, `dtype`)
  - Array reshaping (`reshape`, `flatten`, `ravel`, `transpose`)

### Phase 2: NumPy Array Operations

- **Topics Covered:**
  - Array slicing (1D and 2D)
  - Sorting arrays (1D and 2D, by rows and columns)
  - Filtering arrays using boolean masks
  - Fancy indexing and `np.where`
  - Conditional selection with `np.where(condition, x, y)`
